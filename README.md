Assignment 1 project
This project is made as part of assignment 1 - creating a resume. This website is to present myself as a future potential candidate for my future employers. For this website, I had to plan how I would like it to be designed, these links provided will show my wireframes for both laptop & iphoneX screen: Laptop() IphoneX() I wanted to present myself the best possible way I can, hence I included relevant details like work experience, projects awards and my skill proficiency in the website for my employers to see. Overall, I wanted to give a warm and friendly feel to my employers, hence this colour scheme and background was used to provide that. Some features that I have included is the navigation bar that gives a smooth scroll to particular sections of my website. Button that links to another website to showcase my projects, and a form section with necessary validations. There is also an email me feature that brings the user directly to send an email if they prefer that over the form. Some features I wish to implement as my knowledge for html,css and js grow will be animated features when clicking on the buttons, a sliding feature where it shows various work experience/awards every 10s.
