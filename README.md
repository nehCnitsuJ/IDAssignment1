Assignment 1 project

This project is made as part of assignment 1 - creating a resume. This website is to present myself as a future potential candidate for my future employers. For this website, I had to plan how I would like it to be designed, these links provided will show my wireframes for both laptop & iphoneX screen: Laptop (https://xd.adobe.com/view/44db2ac0-bb40-440b-95cd-2c1bac522d9c-1188/) IphoneX (https://xd.adobe.com/view/1784239c-b893-40a3-b370-2b55e46181de-42d7/) I wanted to present myself the best possible way I can, hence I included relevant details like work experience, projects, awards and my skill proficiency in the website for my employers to see. Overall, I wanted to give a warm and friendly feel to my employers, hence this colour scheme and background was used to provide that.

Some features that I have included is the navigation bar that gives a smooth scroll to particular sections of my website, buttons that link to another website to showcase my projects, and a form section with necessary validations. There is also an email me feature that brings the user directly to send an email if they prefer that over the form. Some features I wish to implement as my knowledge for html,css and js grow will be animated features when clicking on the buttons, a sliding feature where it shows various work experience/awards every 10s. A unique feature that I have implemented is a popup display message where when the user taps on "Read more", it blurs the background and display a popup message containing additional information on my projects. My website works on different websites like Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge both in Laptop and Iphone X version.

For testing this is what I did:
Navigation bar:

1. Clicked on each individual section and see if it scrolls smoothly to the section on the website.

Contact form:

1. Go to "Contacts" page on navigation bar.
2. Input some fields, submit button will indicate field that is required and not filled.
3. Input incorrect email example incorrect placement of '@' and '.', submitting form will indicate error.
4. Input incorrect phone number format example 1 or 23423344548, submitting form will indicate error.
5. A thank you popup message will be displayed only when all validation on the form is fulfilled.

Images with link:

1. Clicked on every image with link and see if it corresponds to the link I intended to reference to.
